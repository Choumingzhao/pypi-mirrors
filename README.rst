pypi-mirrors
============

Very simple tool that pings the PyPI mirrors and tells us when they were updated last. 

I threw this together very quickly as a proof of concept feel free to fork, and send pull requests.

How it works
------------
The ``pypi_mirrors.py`` script runs via a cron job and outputs a simple web page. That is all.
